# Contributing to TrganReport CDN

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository hosts versioned assets (CSS, JS, icons, manifest files) used across the TrganReport reporting ecosystem.

## 🧠 What You Can Contribute

We welcome improvements to:

- `style.css`: Accessibility, layout, typography
- `script.js`: Interactivity, performance, modularity
- `icons/`: New icons or refinements (must be original or properly licensed)
- `site.webmanifest`: Metadata updates

> 🔍 Tip: Explore section-wise asset files to understand how each part of the report is styled and scripted.

## 🚫 What You Should Not Modify

- Published version folders (`v1.2/`, etc.) are **immutable**. Do not modify them directly.
- `logo/`: TrganReport logos are **proprietary** and not open for modification or redistribution.

## 🛠 How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch.
2. Copy the latest version folder (e.g., `v1.2/`) into a new version folder (e.g., `v1.3/`)
3. Make your changes inside the new folder.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
5. Ensure your assets are optimized and properly licensed.

## 📦 Version Folder Naming

- Use `vX.Y` format only (e.g., `v1.3`)
- Do **not** create `v1.2.1`, `v1.2-beta`, or `vNext`
- Each folder must be self-contained and immutable once published
- New versions must increment from the latest published version
- Contributors must propose changes; maintainers assign version numbers
